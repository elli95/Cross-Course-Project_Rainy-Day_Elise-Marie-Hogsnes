<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<!-- 
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

This is the Cross Course Project Rainy Day, made during my first year of education at noroff, autumn 2022 - spring 2023.

This project is the web version of a design assignment carried out during noroff's first semester (spring 2022), based on html, css and javascript.
This website displays an online store specializing in the sale of outdoor jackets for different weather.
You can explore the different pages that show an overview of the different products available and more information about specific products.
Furthermore, it is also possible to simulate a purchase of a product.
However, if you have questions, it is always possible to see what help you can get on the contact page,
otherwise you can always read more about this fictitious company on their about us page.
This is essential what the website contains, I hope you enjoy it.
