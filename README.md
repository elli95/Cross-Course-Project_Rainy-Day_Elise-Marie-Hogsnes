# HTML and CSS Course Assignment by Elise Marie Hogsnes

This is the HTML & CSS course assignment (autumn 2022) and part of the Content Management Systems assignment (spring 2023) by Elise Marie Hogsnes,
from the August 2022 frontend development class, Noroff.
This project shows my version of the rainyDay task.

## Description

This project is the web version, based on html and css, of the design assignment completed earlier in the noroff design course.
This website will display an online store specializing in the sale of rain jackets and other jackets for different weather.
You can explore the different pages that show an overview of the different products available and more information about specific products.
Furthermore, it is also possible to simulate a purchase of a product.
However, if you have questions, it is always possible to see what help you can get on the contact page,
otherwise you can always read more about this fictitious company on their about us page.
This is essential what the website contains, I hope you enjoy.
